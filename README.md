# Slang (Stack-Lang)

made to learn the stages of language translation. Kind of esoteric language, but is not turing complete. 

Stages:
---------
- Lexical Analysis (creating tokens from expression)
- Generate Syntax tree based on language rules and instruction significance
- Syntax tree is recursively traversed and each branch is evaluated
